A project manager for EDOPro extension packs.

---

## Overview

This is an open source command line tool written in Lua, using LuaJIT, to help Yu-Gi-Oh!
card makers for the EDOPro game. It helps the process of managing extension packs:
copying files to the game folder, adding cards to the extension database, generating
card pics, etc.

The name of the project is based on the Portuguese word for factory, _fÃ¡brica_, and is
pronounced just like that, "FAH-bree-kah". From Brazil, with love :green_heart:.

Special thanks to the following artists, since card pic generation was only made possible
thanks to their work:
- [icycatelf](https://www.deviantart.com/icycatelf), with their [templates](https://www.deviantart.com/icycatelf/art/YGO-Series-10-Master-PSD-676448168) for the card proxies.
- [aaiki](https://www.deviantart.com/aaiki), with their [attribute icons](https://www.deviantart.com/aaiki/art/Hi-Res-Yugioh-Attributes-836887394).
